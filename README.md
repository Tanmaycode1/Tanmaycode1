## Experience

**Truffles.ai** — Software Engineer · *May 2025 – Present*  
Architected distributed AI orchestration backend with FastAPI, LangChain, and RAG pipelines. Fine-tuned domain LLMs for credit scoring, achieving 98%+ inference accuracy and reducing analyst latency by 50%.

**Basys.ai** — Software Engineer (Full Stack) · *Nov 2024 – May 2025*  
Built production APIs and multimodal AI pipelines for prior authorization workflows. Implemented HITRUST-aligned security and achieved 99.9% uptime with 20-30% precision improvements.

**Build In Bharat** — Software Engineering Intern · *Sept 2024 – Dec 2024*  
Engineered microservice backends using Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery with autoscaling worker patterns for high-concurrency event pipelines.

**Geek Room** — Founding Member & Technical Lead · *Aug 2023 – Present*  
Co-founded and scaled to 50K+ developers. Lead backend infrastructure and cloud architecture for AI hackathons and community partnerships.
