## 🔎 About

I design and build production-quality systems that combine reliable distributed engineering with applied generative AI. My work centers on architecting scalable backends, orchestration for LLM-driven pipelines, and secure healthcare integrations. I prefer pragmatic systems engineering, measurable impact, and clean APIs.

## 🏆 Experience

### Truffles.ai — **Software Engineer** · *May 2025 – Present*  
- Architected and deployed a distributed AI orchestration backend using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, and multi-source **RAG** pipelines. Built template-aware execution graphs and autonomous agent coordination, reducing analyst latency by **~50%**.  
- Fine-tuned domain LLMs for credit scoring and portfolio risk with quantization and retrieval adapters → **98%+ inference accuracy** for target tasks.

### Basys.ai — **Software Engineer (Full Stack)** · *Nov 2024 – May 2025*  
- Built production APIs and multimodal AI pipelines (FastAPI, Next.js, NestJS) for prior authorization workflows; optimized inference routing and caching to increase precision by **20–30%** while maintaining **99.9% uptime**.  
- Implemented HITRUST-aligned security frameworks and encrypted data exchange for healthcare interoperability.

### Build In Bharat — **Software Engineering Intern** · *Sept 2024 – Dec 2024*  
- Engineered microservice-driven backends using **Django**, **Postgres**, **Redis**, and **Celery** with autoscaling worker patterns and task deduplication for high-concurrency event pipelines.

### Geek Room & SahyogCareForYou — **Founding Member & Technical Lead** · *Aug 2023 – Present*  
- Co-founded and scaled Geek Room to **50K+ developers**. Led backend & cloud infra for AI hackathons and partnerships.  
- Built employee tracking/payment portal for SahyogCareForYou with secure APIs and automated workflows.

## 🚀 Core Projects

### Voice-Controlled Task Agent — *Next.js, FastAPI, WebSockets, Deepgram, Claude/Groq*  
- Voice-first autonomous task agent with real-time bidirectional WebSocket orchestration; deterministic frontend–backend state sync; ASR → LLM tool-calls to manipulate UI (CRUD, navigation, filtering) in real time.

### Financial Agent Backend — *FastAPI, Postgres, Redis, LangChain, Docker, AWS*  
- LLM-powered credit evaluation and portfolio analysis; event-driven routing, Redis-driven caching, containerized microservices for reliability.

### BreastGuard — *PyTorch, Transformers, LoRA, Federated Learning, FastAPI*  
- Multi-modal temporal-transformer screening with LoRA adapters and DP-SGD federated training; deployed as low-latency FastAPI service.
